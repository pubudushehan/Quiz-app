I am creating a project. I am creating a website and it is for students. Students who wish to appear for the advanced level exam 
can register on the website and appear for the pastpaper exam questions. Also they can appear for Model papers (guessing questions). 
Here I first hope to develop this so that student can appear for MCQ quiz. Here, the students get the relevant number of questions 
and selectable answers within a given time. During that time they can mark the answers and finally check their marks and mistakes. 
If you mark the answers before the relevant time, you can finish the quiz and check the marks. Here, to select a question paper, 
you get the opportunity to select the year of the question paper of your stream. There is a separate section for choosing and doing 
Model papers (guessing questions). I hope to design this using JavaScript, HTML, Jason, CSS. Looking to use a database like Mongo later.
